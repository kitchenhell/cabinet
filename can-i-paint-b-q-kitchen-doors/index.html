Yes, kitchen cupboards can be painted with melamine paint. You’ll often find that a kitchen looks tired and dated kitchen because the kitchen units, drawers and doors are worn down and marred. Any eggshell or interior wood paint will work on wooden and already painted kitchen doors. Melamine paint is best to use, as it will give the best finish and will last well.
