IKEA custom kitchen for home IKEA Kitchen Installation From ikeakitcheninstallation.ca
Home experts say that what you find at home depot is likely to be between $20,000 and $25,000 including installation (for an average home project). We used a company that markets themselves as expert assemblers of ikea kitchens, and their assembly and installation cost was literally four times what my contractor had quoted for assembly and installation even if we had we gone. That bumps up the cost of course; Their prices are average at best, and the killer is that their units have no service gap at the back, meaning the kitchen will be far more difficult and therefore more expensive to install.
