Why Do Kitchens Have Two Sinks? Kitchen Bed &amp; Bath From kitchenbedandbath.com
Many people like having a second sink for prep work near a stove or refrigerator. Ideally, i like to have at least 24” of countertop behind the sink faucet. • food preparation sinks are not to be used for hand washing, utensil washing, the disposal of mop water or other wastes, or any other unapproved purpose. This will allow for a 60cm dishwasher, 60cm sink cabinet and a 60cm storage cabinet (i’d recommend a bin cabinet if you don’t have one under your sink).
