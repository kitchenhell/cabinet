The Finished Pantry! Chris Loves Julia From chrislovesjulia.com
In the new kitchen, i turned it inside out, and gained 60 of floor to ceiling pantry cabinets, along with a whole butler�s pantry. Your butler�s pantry should be at least 7 to 8 feet long to have a comfortable working area and room for a countertop. Minimum size, about 6�x4� interior, or 4� square in a corner pantry. Power points for small appliances.
