Modular kitchens IKEA From ikea.com
Hello, we met with a kitchen designer (usa) and had our kitchen design ready to go only to be told that all of the base cabinets are out of stock. Standard sizes for ikea kitchen cabinets are 12”, 15”, 18”, 21”, 24”, 30”, 36”, 38” and 47”. Before the 23 came into stock, the restocking date was october 24th. I�m still waiting for a 24x24x90 tall cabinet.
